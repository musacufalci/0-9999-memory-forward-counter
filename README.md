Simulation and real-time operation of project software: https://youtu.be/Prd7UoJ_l-E

- The circuit works with AC/DC input voltage between 7-12V.
- It counts ADVANCED between 0000-9999 depending on the plus (+) buttons.
- It shows 0000 when RESET button is pressed. (First opened location)
- Displays in the circuit work according to the SCAN method.
- Made with microprocessor.
- It saves the number during the counting process and eliminates the risk of resetting in case of possible power failure. When the power is cut off, the last number appears on the display.
- When the contact is made from a place other than the button on the circuit, there will be no interference and overcounting thanks to the optocoupler built into the circuit.
- Since the circuit dimensions are quite small, it provides savings in the assembly phase.
- Considering that a button is used on the circuit and mechanical inputs such as contactors and other switches can be made at the input, a certain delay time has been set. You can use it in all projects...
